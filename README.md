Plug and play with a wide variety of open source Large Language Models, inside an intuitive and keyboard driven TUI.

This is very much a project in active development, there will be breaking changes, and bugs.
Currently, multi-model chat functionality is available, along with conversation loading and saving.

### Getting Started

To interact with models you will need to set your [Replicate API Key](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens) as the 'REPLICATE_API_KEY' environment variable.

### Installation

#### Arch

archer is on the AUR!

```bash
yay -S archer
```

### Platform Specific Functionality

Archer has only been tested on Linux systems. While all functionality is intended to work cross-platform, there may be concerns working with the clipboard on different platforms. If there are any concerns, please file an Issue.
